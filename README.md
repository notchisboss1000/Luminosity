# Luminosity <br/>
Welcome to Luminosity! A world where **YOU** are the being of legend. You have been awoken after a millennia of rest, due to an event known only as the Dead Moon; where the moon turns blood red and the world exchanges its cheery hue for the spirit of death. Monsters arise and this once-peaceful land quickly arises into disarray. <br/>
